## Description
This project is a demonstration of how to setup a Mongoose server and the routes associated with it. It has the capability to create users, add thought posts to each user and also add to an array of friends for each user. You can create, delete, update and get information about users, thoughts, and reactions to the posts 
## Installation
To install: clone the repo, and then run 'npm i' to install the node modules. This will install the client side and the server side node_modules. You will also need to setup a mongo server running the command 'mongod'  From there running 'npm run develop' will start the server which can then be accessed by a program such as Insomnia 
## Usage
To use this project, access it here via Render: 
[Render URL](https://book-search-engine-whom.onrender.com)

You can also run the server/database locally and then access it via localhost at PORT 3000. You can also use PORT 3001/graphql to access it via Apollo Server as a sandbox to test the data

## Credit
A large portion of this project was provided by the BootCampSpot. It was created as a REST api server, and I ONLY converted it to use mutations/queries. 90% of this is not my original code and was used with permission as a challenge assignment
